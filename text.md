        <h2>Consent Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Consent is more than "no means no" or "yes means yes." Itâ€™s a shared feeling created through constant, collaborative discovery, requiring voluntary agreement without coercion among those with decision-making capacity, knowledge, understanding, and autonomy. It involves slowing down to consider feelings, sensations, and power dynamics.
            Partners should always make sure everyone gives enthusiastic consent and outlines clear boundaries. These boundaries can be laid out in a formal contract, a verbal agreement, or a more casual conversation about desires and limits. 
            Key Questions for Consent:
            How easy is it to talk about your feelings?
            Do you always understand why your body experiences different sensations?
            Do you always know how powerful you are?
