        <h2>What is BDSM?</h2>
        <p>
          BDSM is term used to describe personal dynamics that involve dominance, submission, and control. The practice typically involves one partner taKink on a more dominant role while the other is more submissive. 
          According to a 2016 study, nearly 47% of women and 60% of men have fantasized about dominating someone in a sexual context. The same study found that BDSM sex was slightly more prevalent in couples on the LGBTQ spectrum, but researchers otherwise determined that BDSM sex was practiced across different ages, genders, and ethnic backgrounds.

      <div id="what-is-kink-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>What is "Kink"?</h2>
        <p>
          In human sexuality, kinkiness is the use of sexual practices, concepts or fantasies that are not conventional. The term derives from the idea of a "bend" (cf. a "kink") in one's sexual behavior, to contrast such behavior with "straight" or "vanilla" sexual mores and proclivities. <br><br> It is thus a colloquial term for non-normative sexual behavior. The term "kink" has been claimed by some who practice sexual fetishism as a term or synonym for their practices, indicating a range of sexual and sexualistic practices from playful to sexual objectification and certain paraphilias. In the 21st century the term "kink", along with expressions like BDSM, leather and fetish, has become more commonly used than the term paraphilia. Some universities also feature student organizations focused on kinks, within the context of wider LGBTQ concerns.

          Kink sexual practices go beyond what are considered conventional sexual practices as a means of heightening the intimacy between sexual partners. <br><br> Some draw a distinction between kink and fetishism, defining the former as enhancing partner intimacy, and the latter as replacing it. Because of its relation to conformist sexual boundaries, which themselves vary by time and place, the definition of what is and is not a kink varies widely as well.
          
          Kinks can also be engaged in non-sexually. In one study, up to 35% of participants highly involved in BDSM said it was primarily non-sexual for them. Additionally, people who identify as asexual sometimes engage in kink.
          Kink can be a healthy and empowering way to explore your sexuality, but it’s essential to do so with mutual respect, safety, and consent. By communicating openly with your partner(s), setting clear boundaries, and educating yourself on safe practices, you can ensure that your kink experiences are positive, fulfilling, and affirming.

        <h2>What is a Dom and a Sub?</h2>
        <p>In a relationship with two partners, one will typically play the dominant (dom) role, while the other will play the submissive (sub) role. This dominant and submissive dynamic is often referred to as a top/bottom dynamic. While the dominant partner, or top, is typically the one taKink control in spanKink, bonding, whipping, or other sexual scenarios, the submissive, or bottom, may also keep control by demanding the top perform certain roles or insist on switching roles. </p>

      <div id="consent-frameworks-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Consent Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Consent is more than "no means no" or "yes means yes." It’s a shared feeling created through constant, collaborative discovery, requiring voluntary agreement without coercion among those with decision-making capacity, knowledge, understanding, and autonomy. It involves slowing down to consider feelings, sensations, and power dynamics.
            Partners should always make sure everyone gives enthusiastic consent and outlines clear boundaries. These boundaries can be laid out in a formal contract, a verbal agreement, or a more casual conversation about desires and limits. 
            Key Questions for Consent:
            How easy is it to talk about your feelings?
            Do you always understand why your body experiences different sensations?
            Do you always know how powerful you are?
            <br><br>

            
There are several different schools of thought regarding consent. A few of the major concepts are listed in this section.

        <h2>SSC</h2>
        <p>SSC (Safe, Sane, and Consensual)
            A foundational BDSM principle emphasizing safety, sanity, and mutual consent. Safety involves mitigating risks with safe words, boundaries, and first aid knowledge. Sanity ensures rational decision-making. Consent must be informed, clear, and ongoing. SSC is ideal for beginners but may be limited for complex or extreme play.

        <p>RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink)
            RACK focuses on informed consent to risks in BDSM activities, acknowledging nothing is 100% safe. It emphasizes being well-informed about risks, offering consensual agreement, and engaging in alternative sexual activities. RACK is more inclusive of edgeplay, prioritizing individual commitment to potential risks over minimizing harm post-play.

        <p>An Accountability Circle is a group of respected individuals from the local kink community who provide advice and, if necessary, coordinate an accountability process to address concerns or boundary violations. Members may or may not also serve as accountability contacts.
            Purpose: To offer a safe, impartial mechanism for resolving issues, allowing attendees to discuss concerns anonymously or non-anonymously with a trusted circle member to reach fair resolutions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Impartiality: Accountability contacts should not be romantic or play partners, business associates, or close friends. While some circle members may have closer ties, at least some should be independent to ensure impartiality.</li>
                    <li>Multiple Contacts: Include several accountability contacts to ensure accessibility, so individuals with concerns can choose someone they feel comfortable approaching.</li>
                    <li>Diversity: The circle should reflect racial, gender, and role diversity, providing varied perspectives and feeling approachable to all community members.</li>
                    <li>Trust and Centralization: Choose individuals trusted by both you and the broader community. Designate one person as the central repository for all information to identify patterns of problematic behavior.</li>

      <div id="risk-profiles-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Risk Profiles</h2>
        <p>Definition: A risk profile is a documented list of activities, desires, and limits that acknowledges potential risks in kink play, enabling quick decision-making during scenes. It helps tops and bottoms align on physical and emotional risks during the negotiation phase.</p>
      
        <p>Components of Risk Profile</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Yes, Please: Activities you actively seek.</li>
               <li>Soft Limits: Activities you’re open to exploring under specific conditions.</li>
               <li>Hard Limits: Activities you are not open to engaging in.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Purpose: Risk profiles facilitate informed negotiations by outlining desires, boundaries, and risks for both tops and bottoms, ensuring safer and more consensual play.</p>
            <p>Activities to Consider: When building your risk profile, reflect on the following:</p>

            <div class="kink-list">
                <ul>
                   <li>Breath play</li>

                   <li>Rough body play (kicking, wrestling, punching)</li>
                   <li>Impact play (whip, paddles, flogging, spanking)</li>
                   <li>Suspension bondage (e.g., arm-loading ties like TK)</li>
                   <li>Suspension inversion</li>
                   <li>Restraint (handcuffs, rope, blindfolds)</li>
                   <li>Sex (group, penetration, oral, anal, double penetration)</li>

        <h2>Plan a Scene</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Yes, spontaneity can be fun and sexy, but it is not responsible to be looking for spontaneity with a brand-new partner, especially when there are as many risks to manage as there are with rope. Spontaneity is something that can come with time, experience, and trust with a specific partner. But when you begin playing with someone new, or with an unfamiliar activity, you need to revert to detailed negotiation until you both learn enough about each other to agree to introduce spontaneity.</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Plan what you will do — what is permitted — and how.</li>
               <li>Plan what you will both do if things go according to plan.</li>

               <li>Inspect the things you plan to use. Ensure they are in good condition and are clean.</li>
               <li>Gather safer sex supplies, if applicable.</li>
               <li>Be sure appropriate emergency gear, materials, or medication is within reach.</li>
               <li>Confirm that your phone has plenty of battery and a good signal and that you know the emergency services number for that area.</li>
               <li>Set up appropriate cleanup materials so that this is easy to manage when you are done.</li>

      <div id="physical-preparation-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Physical Preparation</h2>
        <p>Have everyone take care of their physical needs before the scene:</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Hydrate.</li>
               <li>Eat normally – have something about an hour before.</li>

               <li>Check in with yourself to confirm you are in the right headspace to scene.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the scene is to have a D/s component, it can be helpful to give instructions to your partner beforehand, telling them how you want them to prepare.</p>
            <p>Consider wearing clothes that enhance the feeling of the roles you both intend to play. Perhaps the submissive should be naked, perhaps in slutty or revealing clothing, perhaps in a corsets and heels, or a collar and harness.</p>
            <p>This can apply to the Dominant as well. Perhaps you want a classic Fem-Dom look, or a tough look with heavy leather and big boots, or an urbane sophisticate whose suit hides all sorts of kinky secrets. Wear whatever will make you feel how you want to feel.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="mental-preparation-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Mental Preparation</h2>
        <p>It can be helpful to have a preparation ritual to get both of you in the right headspace. Perhaps some outfit, clothes, uniform or maybe you do it at a particular time, maybe you take a bath, read your favorite BDSM book, polish your floggers, watch some inspiring porn, take a look at the this site and the tie you plan, whatever it is that puts you in the right mood.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="during-the-scene-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>During the Scene</h2>
        <p>You made a plan; generally try to follow that plan. But be flexible enough to flow with your partner’s and your own internal reactions. Keep strong communication. Check in on how they are doing from time to time. Remind them to do the sensory and motor checks we discussed in Nerves & Circulation. Remember that most communication is nonverbal. Look for their signals and use them to guide you to be lighter or heavier, more gentle or stronger, etc. Verbally verify if you have any questions.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Critical: Don’t add anything you had not discussed before the scene.</p>
        <p>You can change the plan to make things lighter or to remove a planned element, but never add anything that was not discussed and agreed to before the scene.</p>
        <p>People can enter an altered state of mind when in a scene. They are loving what they are feeling so much they would agree to anything. But agreement in such a state is not real consent. If they did not agree to it before the scene, do not do it during, even if they beg you to. It will take strength, but they will respect that strength the day after when they realize you protected them from themselves.</p>
        <p>Afterward, at a different time when you are negotiating for a different scene, you can ask them if they want to put those things on the table. Maybe they will trust you enough to try more things with you after they’ve seen you keep your word and know that you will put their safety first.</p>

        <h2>If Something goes Wrong</h2>
        <p>Unintentionally having things go awry is not inherently bad. It doesn’t mean that anyone is a bad person or was careless. What matters is what you do if and when it happens.</p>
        <p>Respond quickly and calmly. Stay in control. Do what you said you would do when planning. If needed, gracefully end the scene. Release any elements of bondage and begin caring for whoever needs help. What they will need will be different in each case; use common sense and your preparation to help guide your care.</p>
        <p>Demonstrate that you can be relied upon when things go wrong.</p>

    <!--  AFTERCARE START -->
      <div id="aftercare-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Aftercare</h2>
        <p>The time immediately after you have completed your scene is very important.  It is these few minutes that can affirm that the scene was a wonderful experience or can sour what had otherwise been great.  It is in these moments that you reaffirm each participant.  Confirming that the bottom did well, reassuring the Top that the bottom enjoyed themselves and wanted what they experienced.</p>
        <p>These moments recognize the humanity in all of us and help bring us back to ourselves.</p>
        <p>Everyone will have different needs for aftercare.  You need to make sure you cover this during negotiation so that you know and can meet those needs.</p>

            <ul>
               <li>Aftercare – Make sure everyone is feeling okay and back to a normal state of mind. Do as you discussed while planning. Take care of each other.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Over-the-counter pain medications (particularly ibuprofen and naproxen) help reduce inflammation and soreness that may be felt from micro-tears in muscle fibers that may happen if muscles have been stretched or put under stress beyond what they normally experience. Note, however, that aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen also tend to thin the blood a little (acetaminophen does not). If your partner is taking any medication that would conflict with a painkiller like this (prescription blood thinners, for example), it is critical that they follow all medical directives/limitations associated with their other medication.</p>

        <h2>Post-Scene Processing</h2>
        <p>You have been through an experience. You will be mentally and emotionally processing that experience, perhaps for several days. You also may have had various hormones and neurotransmitters rushing through your system due to what you experienced.</p>
        <p>It is entirely normal to experience heightened emotions for a few days or to feel what we call “drop” (“Top drop”, “sub drop”). This is when you feel a little depressed. This is a common reaction to the highs that you felt. It is easy for some people to confuse this mostly physiological process with regret. If you are playing with someone new, make sure they understand that this might happen and that it is a normal physiological reaction that will pass. Invite them to contact you to discuss it if they wish, or offer to reach out to them in a few days to check in with them if they would like you to.  (Don’t just tell them you will do so however, tell them you would be happy to do so and ask them if they would like you to.)</p>

        <h2>Rope Suspension</h2>
         <p>Shibari, in Japanese, simply means "to tie". It refers to a Japanese practice that involves using rope to tie individuals in various ways, often with an emphasis on visual aesthetics and visual expression. This practice can be explored as a form of bondage, a sexual activity, and/or a form of artistic expression. <br><br> Shibari places a strong emphasis on the visual appearance of the ties, often resulting in intricate and visually striking designs. In Shibari, there's typically a "rigger" who ties the individual, and the person being tied is often referred to as the "bottom" or "rope bunny".  </p>

          <p>Suspension Checklist:</p>
          <p>Rigger Readiness: Ensure you’re fully prepared to take on the responsibility of a suspension scene by confirming the following:</p>
          <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Do you have the skill and experience for the planned scene?</li>
               <li>Are you mentally, physically, and emotionally fit to handle this responsibility?</li>
               <li>Do you have the energy and focus required?</li>
               <li>Are your faculties unimpaired (e.g., not under the influence)?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Equipment and Environment: Verify the safety and readiness of your setup:</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Have you checked the hardpoint and physical scene for hazards?</li>
               <li>Have you inspected your gear, equipment, and ropes?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Scene Planning: Confirm all plans are in place:</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Do you have clear plans for the scene?</li>
               <li>Is your partner ready overall and for the specific scene?</li>
               <li>Have you planned for potential issues, such as numbness, tingling, hypoglycemia, panic attacks, fainting, falls, or emergency let-down/cut-the-rope scenarios?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Post-Scene: Prepare for after the scene:</p>

      <div id="bottoms-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Bottoms</h2>
        <p>Preparation: Suspension requires effort from bottoms too. Work on flexibility and strength to manage discomfort and shift pressure during scenes. Know your body’s needs and capabilities, and communicate any medical issues, especially related to joints, muscles, heart, circulatory system, or diabetes.</p>
        <p>Communication: Your rigger aims to position ropes safely to avoid pinching nerves or blood vessels, but individual anatomy varies. Immediately report any numbness, tingling, or unexpected sensations. If a limb feels “dead” (e.g., unable to move fingers or toes), inform your rigger right away to adjust or undo the rope.</p>
        <p>Safety Tips:</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Start with Experience: For your first suspension, work with an experienced rigger to learn safely and gain confidence.</li>
               <li>Trusted Partners: If concerned about a rigger’s experience, suggest including a trusted, experienced partner for initial sessions to enhance safety and fun.</li>
               <li>Avoid Gags Initially: With a new rigger, avoid gags for the first few sessions to ensure clear verbal communication until non-verbal cues are established.</li>
            </ul>

      <div id="impact-play-content" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Impact Play</h2>
        <p>Impact play is a human sexual practice in which one person is struck (usually repeatedly) by another person for the gratification of either or both parties which may or may not be sexual in nature. It is considered a form of BDSM. There are several activities that qualify as impact play. In erotic spanking the sub is struck on the buttocks either with the Dominant's open hand, or a rigid implement such as a paddle, cane or riding crop. In the latter case the activity is often referred to as paddling, caning or cropping. In erotic flagellation the sub is struck with a flexible implement such as a whip or belt.</p>
        <p>Whips are classified by how many falls they have:</p>
        <div class="kink-list">
            <ul>
               <li>Single tails such as a bullwhip have a single fall. The associated activity is referred to as single tailing. </li>
               <li>Floggers, such as a cat o' nine tails have many falls. The associated activity is referred to as flogging. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>For safety, impact play should be done on areas of the human body well protected by fat or muscle; spots to avoid include the kidneys, neck, tailbone, hipbones, the head and all joints. The usual targets for flagellation are the buttocks and the two areas of the upper back below the shoulder blades. With care, the thighs, the backs of the calves and the chest can be targets as well. Breasts are another potential (but high-risk) target and should only be used with experience. The use of a whip means that the Dom must take great care to hit the intended target area and avoid wrapping; when a whip or flogger contacts the target area somewhere up its length and the remaining length wraps around the sub's body to deliver a sharp, non-erotic, and possibly injurious off-target blow, such as to the hipbones or ribs. The longer the falls, the more skill is required by the Dom to land a safe blow. Advanced flogging techniques use a pair of floggers employed in a martial arts style alternating pattern, a technique commonly referred to as "florentining" or "florentine flogging." </p>
        <p>Less common forms of impact play include punching and face slapping. The sensations produced by impact play depend on the area in which the impact is concentrated. Wide implements such as an open hand, paddle or flogger produce a dull "thuddy" sensation. Narrow implements such as a cane, riding crop, belt or single tail produce a sharp "stingy" sensation. A slapper or smacker may also be used. This consists of a broad (3 to 4 inch wide) semi flexible leather paddle with rounded and tapered edges, designed to minimize the severity of tip strikes. </p>

        <h2>What are Kink Events?</h2>
        <p>Kink events are gatherings that focus on exploring and experiencing sexual activities that fall outside of typical, mainstream sexual behavior. These events can vary greatly in their focus and intensity, ranging from more social and theatrical performances to private play sessions. </p>

            <h2>Safety at Haus of Razorfist</h2>
            <p>Safety at kink events, like many aspects of kink, revolves around the principles of Consent, Negotiation, and overall safety of attendees. Haus of Razorfist attempts to create a safe environment for the community to gather. As such, the safety of attendees is addressed in various ways. </p>

          <div id="vetting-process-content" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Vetting Process</h2>
            <p>The events are vetted, and as such only approved attendees will be allowed to enter. This is both to manage the overall vibe of the events and bring like-minded people together.</p>
            <p>Not everyone will be approved. That doesn't mean we love you any less, but it's our job to curate something amazing, safe, and with people of a similar vibe, and as such some will be declined.</p>
            <p>Reasons for not being approved:</p>
            <div class="kink-list">
                <ul>
                   <li>Lack of detailed Fetlife profile</li>
                   <li>No referrals</li>

    <div id="safe-words-content" class="tab-content">
      <h2>Safe Words</h2>
      <p>Because of the intense nature of some BDSM scenes, it is also important to introduce a safe word. If one partner becomes uncomfortable with any part of the experience, they can speak the word to stop the current act – or stop the sex altogether. </p>
      <p>Another way to negotiate boundaries is through the traffic light system. Each color communicates how a partner is feeling and what they want. Red means they want the partner to stop what they’re doing immediately. Yellow means they want their partner to slow down, either because of physical discomfort or reaching a limit. Green means they like what the partner is doing, they feel comfortable, and they want  to keep going.</p>
      <p>Before you take part in more intense forms of erotic play – like the use of whips, advanced bondage techniques, or sex toys– it’s a good idea to educate yourself on these practices first, through classes, books, or instructional online content.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="dungeon-monitors-content" class="tab-content">
      <h2>Dungeon Monitors</h2>
      <p>A dungeon monitor, sometimes referred to as simply "DM", is a person charged with supervising a playspace (or "dungeon") at BDSM events such as play parties and fetish clubs. A dungeon monitor may be of any sex or gender, and may normally identify as any role (dominant, submissive, or switch). On duty, their authority is absolute. If a Dungeon Monitor orders a play scene to stop, it must be stopped immediately.</p>
      <p>Primary Responsibility: Ensure the physical safety of all participants engaging in BDSM play.</p>
      <p>Structure: In most cases, there is a team of Dungeon Monitors, led by one or more Chief Dungeon Monitors. At private parties, it is typically the host's role to act as a Chief Dungeon Monitor or to nominate an attendee to serve in that capacity, possibly along with one or more additional Dungeon Monitors.</p>
      <p>Responsibilities:</p>
      <div class="kink-list">
          <ul>
             <li>Monitor play scenes and enforce house rules, which list prohibited activities, the default safeword, and sometimes a safe gesture.</li>
             <li>Maintain dungeon equipment between scenes, ensuring players clean surfaces and equipment after use (usually with disinfectants), replace pads, and ready the play area safely for its next scene.</li>
          </ul>
